## 🤔 **What is this program about?**

* Program which creates secured data-bases by using RSA & SHA512 decryption.
* Data Base may contain your login, password for every website / client.
* Program allows to generate original and safe password, if your password isn't that safe or original.
* After creating a data-base you will always be able to view your data, even on different PC, but you should copy `.db` files somewhere and import them then.
* If you use the program on someone's PC we recommend to not leave `.db` files and save them somewhere, too.

## ⚡ **Installation**

There is 2 ways *(Easy and Advanced)* of getting program on your PC so let's check them out really quick and really easily.

## 📝 **FAQ**

* Q: Why do anyone need it when Google, Apple and others already have the auto-saves on their devices & web-browsers?
* A: Actually, I saw my teachers have a huge amount of saved passwords / logins, but they are incorrent in most cases and they don't even edit already saved passwords. Maybe this project will make them to edit / save the actual data.

* A: No.

* Q: Android / iOS supported?
* A: Maybe later, but we aren't sure at all.

* A: Yes, but not just copy-pasted. The original creator and repo are mentioned in our [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/Kerman1337/Keyforgetful/security/policy). We are not telling the untruth to anyone.

* Q: Who are you?
* A: [Rockstar234](https://github.com/Rockstar234). Secrets stay secret.

* Q: Did anyone help you? *(teacher's question)*
* A: Yes, but secrets stay secret.
